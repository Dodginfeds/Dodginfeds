- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Nazir, and I'm a sophomore Computer Science major!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in alot more than just Computer Science. I have a newfound passion for product design (3d modeling as well as printing), Graphic Design, architecture, Production, Video editing, and much more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a couple of things at once.
-   I want to be a more efficient programmer, but I am still learning the basics of Python.
I'm also learning to 3D model. I've turned some projects into physical products, and I'm always happy with the results!
-   I'm learning how to work on cars on my own time, as well as video production and graphic design!
- It can be essential to have multiple different interests to keep yourself motivated and serve the purpose of being well-rounded!
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything! I love learning new things and challenges and overcoming them even more!
